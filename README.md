# EasyDaddy – Smart Autofill Chrome Extension

> ⚡ Save hours on repetitive form-filling. EasyDaddy uses LLMs to understand the web page you're on and fills out the right information from your personal or project profiles – even complex answers like motivation letters or pitch descriptions.

---

## ✨ Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Multiple Profiles** | Switch between Personal, Startup, Freelance CV, etc. |
| **Intelligent Autofill** | ChatGPT analyses page context & maps your data to each field. |
| **File Import** | Drop `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.md` with your CV / project brief – EasyDaddy extracts structured data automatically. |
| **Local-first Storage** | All profiles are kept in your browser's IndexedDB (AES-GCM encrypted). |
| **One-click "Fill Out"** | Hit the button in the popup – forms are scanned and populated instantly. |
| **Highlight & Edit** | Newly filled fields flash yellow for 1 s so you can review / tweak. |

## 🔑 OpenAI Integration

* **Analysis Prompt** – extracts structured data from raw text / PDFs
* **Autofill Prompt** – returns JSON `{ cssSelector: "value" }`
* All network calls happen in `background.ts` to keep the API key out of the page context.

> The API key is _never_ injected into content scripts.

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

* Profiles encrypted at rest with AES-GCM (WebCrypto).
* EasyDaddy requests the minimal host permissions (`<all_urls>` only for autofill).
* Inline‐scripts & `eval` are blocked to comply with Chrome Store policies.
